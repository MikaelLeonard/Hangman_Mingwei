#Hangman Project 

#Prepare a dictionary of words to choose from and save it in a txt file (one column) and save it in the project directory
#Read the word list from your program.
#Choose a random element from the list. Hint: You may want to check sample() and sample.int()  functions. There are many different ways of doing this. You are welcome to experiment.
#Inform the user on the length of the secret word. Hint: You may test nchar()
#Inform the user about the number of wrong guesses/tries allowed. You decide on the rule here and implement it. Please comment your code appropriately.
#Ask for user input. The user is expected to enter one character only, check for this.
#Optional; check if the character is a letter
#Optional: make sure that both lower and upper case letters are acceptable and treated as equivalent
#Check to see if the user input is in the secret word.
#If yes, notify user and ask for next letter
#If not, notify user.
#If user has not exhausted the available tries, ask for the next letter.
#If tries are exhausted, notify user that theyâ€™ve lost. Reveal secret and exit.
#Make sure that your code never goes into an infinite loop, and always manages to exit gracefully (ie without throwing an error)
#Always notify the user about the correct letters/wrong letters, remaining tries.
